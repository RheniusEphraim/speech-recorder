# speech-recorder

speech-recorder is a cross-platform, native [node.js](https://nodejs.org) [addon](http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) for getting a stream of audio from a device's microphone. Using speech-recorder, you can also get only the audio that corresponds to someone speaking.

This module is used for speech recognition in [Serenade](https://serenade.ai). Serenade enables you to write code through natural speech, rather than typing.

## Installation

speech-recorder has been tested on Windows 10, macOS 10.14+, and Ubuntu 18.04+ (and may work on other platforms as well).

To install speech-recorder, run:

    yarn add speech-recorder

If you're using this library with Electron, you should probably use [electron-rebuild](https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild).

## Usage

### Devices

You can get a list of supported devices with:

    import { getDevices } from "speech-recorder";

    console.log(getDevices());

### Streaming

You can write all audio to a file with:

    import { SpeechRecorder } from "speech-recorder";

    const recorder = new SpeechRecorder();
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("audio.raw");

    recorder.start({
      onAudio: (audio) => {
        writeStream.write(audio);
      }
    });

Or, just the speech with:

    import { SpeechRecorder } from "speech-recorder";

    const recorder = new SpeechRecorder({ sampleRate: 16000, framesPerBuffer: 320 });
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("audio.raw");

    recorder.start({
      onAudio: (audio, speech) => {
        if (speech) {
          writeStream.write(audio);
        }
      }
    });

The `SpeechRecorder` constructor supports the following options:

-   `error`: callback called on audio stream error. defaults to `null`.
-   `framesPerBuffer`: the number of audio frames to read at a time. defaults to `320`.
-   `highWaterMark`: the `highWaterMark` to be applied to the underlying stream, or how much audio can be buffered in memory. defaults to `64000` (64kb).
-   `leadingPadding`: the number of frames to buffer at the start of a speech chunk. this can be prevent audio at the start of the file from getting cut off. defaults to `30`.
-   `level`: the VAD aggressiveness level on a scale of 0-3, with 0 being the least aggressive and 3 being the most aggressive. defaults to `3`.
-   `sampleRate`: the sample rate for the audio; must be 8000, 16000, 32000, or 48000. defaults to `16000`.
-   `speakingThreshold`: the number of consecutive speaking frames before considering speech to have started.
-   `silenceThreshold`: the number of consecutive non-speaking frames before considering speech to be finished.
-   `triggers`: a list of `Trigger` objects that can optionally specify when the `onTrigger` callback is executed.

The `start` method supports the following options:

-   `deviceId`: `id` value from `getDevices` corresponding to the device you want to use; a value of `-1` uses the default device.
-   `onAudio`: a callback to be executed when audio data is received from the mic. will be passed `(audio, speaking, speech, volume, silence)`, where `audio` is the buffer of audio data, `speaking` is whether or not we're in the speaking state, `speech` is whether the current frame is speech (recall that consecutive non-speaking frames must be found to exit the speaking state, so `speaking` and `speech` can be different), `volume` is the volume of the audio, and `silence` is the number of consecutive silence frames that have been heard.
-   `onChunkStart`: a callback to be executed when a speech chunk starts. will be passed the leading buffer, whose size is determined by `leadingPadding`.
-   `onChunkEnd`: a callback to be executed when a speech chunk ends.
-   `onTrigger`: a callback to be executed when a trigger threshold is met.
